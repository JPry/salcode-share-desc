## Description

This plugin adds a section called "Social Share" to the Document sidebar in the editor. This "Social Share" section contains a field to populate the `og:description` meta tag when the front-end page is rendered.

This plugin was created to document the steps in creating a plugin that uses the `@wordpress/scripts` JavaScript library and interacts with the WordPress block editor (a.k.a. Gutenberg). Going through each commit and reading the commit message that goes with it is recommended for those wanting to learn more.
